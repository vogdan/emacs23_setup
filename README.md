emacs_setup
===========

Initially intended as a simple IDE for Python, this setup should provide code browsing (via ECB) and code copletion (via auto-complete and ac-python) for at least `python`, `bash` and `tcl`.

Tested and worked on `GNU Emacs 23.1.1 (Ubuntu)` & `23.4.1 (Linux Mint)` (**32 bit**). 


   
#### How To
```  
    1. Downolad repo in your home path
    2. mv emacs_setup .emacs.d
    3. ln -s .emacs.d/dot-emacs .emacs
    4. Enjoy.
```
